# Workout-Tracker
A simple tracker for recording workouts
This app should have the ability to:
1. Select/Create workout scheme
2. Choose the type of workout such as: Full-Body or Partial-Body
3. Choose from a list of Single-Joint and Multi-Joint excercises
4. Track the time and date for the workout: example: Last Workout was on July 15, 2018, Duration was 1 hour and 38 minutes
5. This app should have a timer to count the rest time.

Extra Features for future updates:
1. Have the option of the device speak or interact: example: "Ten, Nine, Eight..."
2. Manipulate the app data with voice commands
3. Have the device vibrate at the end of the timers
4. Collect lifetime data features, such as: Total weight lifted since using the app is 10,580 pounds
5. (Any new ideas or suggestions go here).
